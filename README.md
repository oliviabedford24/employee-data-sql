# sql-challenge

This is the Module 9 Challenge for Rice University's Data Visualization Bootcamp. In this challenge, we used SQL to model, engineer, and analyze data from the fictional company Pewlett Hackard. 

The 'Resources' folder in this directory contains the Excel files containing the data sets used in this challenge. The EmployeeSQLdata folder contains the schema used to engineer the data (titled 'sql-challenge-schema-2.sql'), and the code used to analyze the data (titled 'sql-challenge-analysis.sql'). The model of the data is contained in the ERD jpg file.

The code was written in pgAdmin. For best results, run the code in pgAdmin or other SQL-friendly software.

The code contained in this directory is my work and mine alone. I received input and guidance from my instructors and the tutors employed by Rice University, but the code itself is my work.

Thank you!
